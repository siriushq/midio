==============

	There are many available sources of documentation for users and contributors.
	Non-rendered source documentation is available in the "documentation" directory.
	https://midio.sirius.cam houses the rendered documentation.

	You are required to read [license] and [/attribution/*] before using this software.

	<!> The rendered documentation is currently not public.
	<!> 1.0-RC1 is not yet published.

	<ⓘ> Contact "midio@mechite.com" for support (more information below...)
	<ⓘ> It is not a goal of this project to fork the other tools, such as `mc`.

building
========

	The preferred environment uses Git and Go >1.25.

	$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:siriushq/midio.git
	$ cd midio
	$ go generate
	$ go build

	This produces a runnable binary for the system you are building on.
	[go generate] will fail if you did not clone the repository maintaining [.git].

	To generate license files, you must ensure both [go] and [GOPATH/bin] are available
	in your [PATH] environment variable, and then run the following:

	$ go install github.com/google/go-licenses/v2@v2.0.0
	$ go-licenses report github.com/siriushq/midio \
		--template ./attribution/license-dependencies.tpl \
		> ./attribution/license-dependencies.md

contributing
============

	Contributions are accepted as long as they fall within implied project scope.

	All commits must contain at least `Signed-off-by` to identify the author of the
	contribution, and may contain `Co-authored-by` to attach any number of other
	authors (this can be added automatically with `git commit ... -s ...`).

	(furthermore, commits from people with repository write access are to be signed
	with a verified GPG, SSH or S/MIME signature attached to your GitHub account).

	Relevant documentation should be updated to include accrediting.

	By submitting a contribution, you certify that you and other authors are making
	your contribution available under the license of the project, and that you have
	the rights to submit it.
